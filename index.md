title: Minnowbrook Logic Programming Seminar
---

This technical seminar is meant to be something like a Dagstuhl
seminar for a specific perspective on Datalog and its extensions. I
say “logic programming,” as I think many of us care chiefly about
using logic and declarative methods to solve problems or develop
beautiful solutions. I have invited many folks who have worked on
Datalog in particular, but I am most excited about getting a breadth
of folks with orthogonal perspectives and motivations that can
fruitfully enjoy each others’ company.

We will have technical talks (you give a lecture to us), brainstorming
sessions/hackathons, and group time, along with outdoor activities /
games / food / etc. All within the backdrop of Minnowbrook lodge, a
pictersque
